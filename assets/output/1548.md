## 题目

We have `n` cities and `m` bi-directional `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi]`
connects city `ai` with city `bi`. Each city has a name consisting of exactly
three upper-case English letters given in the string array `names`. Starting
at any city `x`, you can reach any city `y` where `y != x` (i.e., the cities
and the roads are forming an undirected connected graph).

You will be given a string array `targetPath`. You should find a path in the
graph of the **same length** and with the **minimum edit distance** to
`targetPath`.

You need to return _the order of the nodes in the path with the minimum edit
distance_. The path should be of the same length of `targetPath` and should be
valid (i.e., there should be a direct road between `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]`).
If there are multiple answers return any one of them.

The **edit distance** is defined as follows:

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 100`
  * `m == roads.length`
  * `n - 1 <= m <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
  * `ai != bi`
  * The graph is guaranteed to be **connected** and each pair of nodes may have **at most one** direct road.
  * `names.length == n`
  * `names[i].length == 3`
  * `names[i]` consists of upper-case English letters.
  * There can be two cities with **the same** name.
  * `1 <= targetPath.length <= 100`
  * `targetPath[i].length == 3`
  * `targetPath[i]` consists of upper-case English letters.



**Follow up:** If each node can be visited only once in the path, What should
you change in your solution?


## 题目大意

我们有 `n` 座城市和 `m` 条双向道路 `roads` ，其中 `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` 连接城市 `ai` 和城市
`bi`。每个城市的名称由字符串数组 `names` 中给出的三个大写英文字母组成。从任意城市 `x` 出发，你可以到达任意城市 `y` ，其中 `y !=
x` （即：城市和道路形成一张无向连通图）。

给定一个字符串数组 `targetPath`，你需要找出图中与 `targetPath` 的**长度相同** 且**编辑距离****最小** 的路径。

你需要返回 __**编辑距离最小的路径中节点的顺序** __ 。该路径应当与 `targetPath` 的长度相等，且路径需有效（即： `ans[i]` 和
`ans[i + 1]` 间应存在直接连通的道路）。如果有多个答案，返回任意一个。

**编辑距离** 的定义如下：

**提示：**

  * `2 <= n <= 100`
  * `m == roads.length`
  * `n - 1 <= m <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
  * `ai != bi `
  * 给定的图保证是**连通** 的，任意两个节点**至多有一个** 直接连通的道路。
  * `names.length == n`
  * `names[i].length == 3`
  * `names[i]` 包含大写英文字母。
  * 可能有两个名称**相同** 的城市。
  * `1 <= targetPath.length <= 100`
  * `targetPath[i].length == 3`
  * `targetPath[i]` 由大写英文字母组成。



**进阶：** 如果路径中每个节点只可访问一次，你该如何修改你的答案？

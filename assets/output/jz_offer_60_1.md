## 题目大意

你选择掷出 `num` 个色子，请返回所有点数总和的概率。

你需要用一个浮点数数组返回答案，其中第 `i` 个元素代表这 `num` 个骰子所能掷出的点数集合中第 `i` 小的那个的概率。



**示例 1：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** num = 3
> 
> **输出：**[0.00463,0.01389,0.02778,0.04630,0.06944,0.09722,0.11574,0.12500,0.12500,0.11574,0.09722,0.06944,0.04630,0.02778,0.01389,0.00463]

**示例  2：**

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> **输入：** num = 5
> 
> **输出:**[0.00013,0.00064,0.00193,0.00450,0.00900,0.01620,0.02636,0.03922,0.05401,0.06944,0.08372,0.09452,0.10031,0.10031,0.09452,0.08372,0.06944,0.05401,0.03922,0.02636,0.01620,0.00900,0.00450,0.00193,0.00064,0.00013]

**提示：**

  * `1 <= num <= 11`

## 题目

You are given a large sample of integers in the range `[0, 255]`. Since the
sample is so large, it is represented by an array `count` where `count[k]` is
the **number of times** that `k` appears in the sample.

Calculate the following statistics:

  * `minimum`: The minimum element in the sample.
  * `maximum`: The maximum element in the sample.
  * `mean`: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
  * `median`: 
> 
> * If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the `median` is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
> 
> * If the sample has an even number of elements, then the `median` is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.
  * `mode`: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be **unique**.

Return _the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point
numbers_`[minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]`_. Answers within_`10-5` _of
the actual answer will be accepted._

**Constraints:**

  * `count.length == 256`
  * `0 <= count[i] <= 10^9`
  * `1 <= sum(count) <= 10^9`
  * The mode of the sample that `count` represents is **unique**.


## 题目大意

我们对 `0` 到 `255` 之间的整数进行采样，并将结果存储在数组 `count` 中：`count[k]` 就是整数 `k` 在样本中出现的次数。

计算以下统计数据:

  * `minimum` ：样本中的最小元素。
  * `maximum` ：样品中的最大元素。
  * `mean` ：样本的平均值，计算为所有元素的总和除以元素总数。
  * `median` ： 
> 
> * 如果样本的元素个数是奇数，那么一旦样本排序后，中位数 `median` 就是中间的元素。
> 
> * 如果样本中有偶数个元素，那么中位数`median` 就是样本排序后中间两个元素的平均值。
  * `mode` ：样本中出现次数最多的数字。保众数是 **唯一** 的。

以浮点数数组的形式返回样本的统计信息 _ _`[minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]` 。与真实答案误差在 _
_`10-5` _ _ 内的答案都可以通过。

**提示：**

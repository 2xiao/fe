## 题目

There is a company with `n` branches across the country, some of which are
connected by roads. Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by
traveling some roads.

The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time
traveling between their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down
some of these branches (**possibly none**). However, they want to ensure that
the remaining branches have a distance of at most `maxDistance` from each
other.

The **distance** between two branches is the **minimum** total traveled length
needed to reach one branch from another.

You are given integers `n`, `maxDistance`, and a **0-indexed** 2D array
`roads`, where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` represents the **undirected** road
between branches `ui` and `vi` with length `wi`.

Return _the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch
has a distance of at most_`maxDistance` _from any other_.

**Note** that, after closing a branch, the company will no longer have access
to any roads connected to it.

**Note** that, multiple roads are allowed.



**Example 1:**

> Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,2],[1,2,10],[0,2,10]]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
> - The set [2], after closing, active branches are [0,1] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
> - The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
> - The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
> - The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
> - The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
> 
> It can be proven, that there are only 5 possible sets of closing branches.

**Example 2:**

> Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,20],[0,1,10],[1,2,2],[0,2,2]]
> 
> Output: 7
> 
> Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
> - The set [], after closing, active branches are [0,1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 4.
> - The set [0], after closing, active branches are [1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
> - The set [1], after closing, active branches are [0,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
> - The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
> - The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
> - The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
> - The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
> 
> It can be proven, that there are only 7 possible sets of closing branches.

**Example 3:**

> Input: n = 1, maxDistance = 10, roads = []
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
> - The set [], after closing, the active branch is [0].
> - The set [0], after closing, there are no active branches.
> 
> It can be proven, that there are only 2 possible sets of closing branches.

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 10`
  * `1 <= maxDistance <= 10^5`
  * `0 <= roads.length <= 1000`
  * `roads[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `1 <= wi <= 1000`
  * All branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.


## 题目大意

一个公司在全国有 `n` 个分部，它们之间有的有道路连接。一开始，所有分部通过这些道路两两之间互相可以到达。

公司意识到在分部之间旅行花费了太多时间，所以它们决定关闭一些分部（**也可能不关闭任何分部** ），同时保证剩下的分部之间两两互相可以到达且最远距离不超过
`maxDistance` 。

两个分部之间的 **距离** 是通过道路长度之和的 **最小值**  。

给你整数 `n` ，`maxDistance` 和下标从 **0**  开始的二维整数数组 `roads` ，其中 `roads[i] = [ui, vi,
wi]` 表示一条从 `ui` 到 `vi` 长度为 `wi`的 **无向**  道路。

请你返回关闭分部的可行方案数目，满足每个方案里剩余分部之间的最远距离不超过 _ _`maxDistance`。

**注意** ，关闭一个分部后，与之相连的所有道路不可通行。

**注意** ，两个分部之间可能会有多条道路。

**提示：**

  * `1 <= n <= 10`
  * `1 <= maxDistance <= 10^5`
  * `0 <= roads.length <= 1000`
  * `roads[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `1 <= wi <= 1000`
  * 一开始所有分部之间通过道路互相可以到达。
